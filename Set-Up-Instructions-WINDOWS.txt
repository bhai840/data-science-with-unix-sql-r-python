## DETERMINE IF YOUR COMPUTER IS 32-BIT OR 64-BIT ##

1. Go to: http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/find-out-32-or-64-bit

2. Follow the instructions to determine if your computer is 32-bit or 64-bit



## INSTALL CYGWIN ##

1. Go to: https://cygwin.com/install.html

2. If your computer is 32-bit, click the 32-bit set-up executable (e.g. setup-x86.exe)

2. If your computer is 64-bit, click the 64-bit set-up executable (e.g. setup-x86_64.exe)

3. Follow the default set-up instructions
Note: After you install Cygwin, you re-run the same setup-x86.exe or setup-x86_64.exe executable to check your installation and to add / remove items
(On the “Select Packages” page, make sure the following items are installed or will be installed.  By default, they should be, but it’s good to check.  Also, don’t simply try to install everything…it will take forever to install everything and you don’t need everything.  Also, other items will be installed by default and that’s fine.)
